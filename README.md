# RinHash CUDA Implementation

ðŸš€ High-performance GPU implementation of RinHash â€“ an ASIC-resistant hashing algorithm designed for RinCoin mining.

## ðŸ”§ Algorithm Overview

RinHash is a custom Proof-of-Work algorithm designed to resist ASICs by combining three cryptographic hash functions:

1. **BLAKE3** â€“ Fast and modern hashing.
2. **Argon2d** â€“ Memory-hard password hashing (64KB, 2 iterations).
3. **SHA3-256** â€“ Secure final hash.

The final output is a 32-byte SHA3-256 digest of the Argon2d result, which itself is applied to the BLAKE3 hash of the input block header.
